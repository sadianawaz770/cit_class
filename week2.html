			<td colspan="4">Sir Isaac Newton</b><i>25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27</i> was an English <u>mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author</u> (described in his time as a "natural philosopher") widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">[1]</sup></a>. His book <big>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</big> (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in <tt>1687</tt>, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with <small>German mathematician</small> Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus<sup><a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">[2]</sup></a>.</p><img src="888.jpg">
