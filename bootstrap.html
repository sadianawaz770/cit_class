			<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931)</b> was an American inventor and businessman. He developed many devices in fields such as <u>electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera</u>, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world.He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote>Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career, he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions.</blockquote> In <i>1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed</i>. He later established a botanical laboratory in <big>Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange</big>, New Jersey, that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. He was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name,as well as patents in other countries.<tt> Edison married twice and fathered six children</tt>. <strong>He died in 1931 of complications of diabetes.</strong></p><hr>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Edison was granted a patent for a motion picture camera, <tt>labeled the "Kinetograph". He did the electromechanical design while his employee William Kennedy Dickson, a photographer</tt>, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.[52] In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Edison's film studio made nearly 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott's Sneeze (1894), The Kiss (1896), The Great Train Robbery (1903), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910), and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), <small>Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant.</small></p>
